    "abstract":"Abstract Hydrogen storage has long been a priority on the renewable energy research agenda. Due to its high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen density, MgH 2 is a desirable candidate for solid‐state hydrogen storage. However, its practical use is constrained by high thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. Here, PdNi bilayer metallenes are reported as catalysts for hydrogen storage of bulk‐MgH 2 near ambient temperature. Unprecedented 422 K beginning dehydrogenation temperature and up to 6.36 wt.% reliable hydrogen storage capacity are achieved. Fast hydrogen desorption is also provided by the system (5.49 wt.% in 1 h, 523 K). The in situ generated PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d ‐band centers are identified as the main active sites during the de\/re‐hydrogenation process by aberration‐corrected transmission electron microscopy and theoretical simulations, while other active species including Pd\/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd\/Ni single atoms obtained via metallene ball milling, also enhance the reaction. These findings present fundamental insights into active species identification and rational design of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials.",

Mass production of high‐purity hydrogen fuel from seawater electrolysis presents a transformative technology for sustainable alternatives. Here, a heterostructure of molybdenum selenide‐nickel selenide (Mo 3 Se 4 ‐NiSe) core–shell nanowire arrays constructed on nickel foam by a single‐step in situ hydrothermal process is reported. This tiered structure provides improved intrinsic activity and high electrical conductivity for efficient charge transfer and endows excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline and natural seawater conditions. The Mo 3 Se 4 ‐NiSe freestanding electrodes require small overpotentials of 84.4 and 166 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline and natural seawater electrolytes, respectively. It maintains an impressive balance between electrocatalytic activity and stability. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Mo 3 Se 4 ‐NiSe interface provides abundant active sites for the HER process, which modulate the binding energies of adsorbed species and decrease the energetic barrier, providing a new route to design state‐of‐the‐art, PGM‐free catalysts for hydrogen production from alkaline and seawater electrolysis.",

However, breaking the self‐adaption of tumors and improving the sustainable remodeling TME ability remains a major challenge for developing novel nanozymes. Here, a rapid method is developed first to synthesize unprecedented trimetalic nanozyme (AuMnCu, AMC) with a targeting peptide (AMCc), which exhibits excellent peroxidase‐like, catalase‐like, and glucose oxidase‐like activities. The released Cu and Mn ions in TME consume endogenous H 2 O 2 and produce O 2 , while the AMCccatalyzes glucose oxidation reaction to generate H 2 O 2 and gluconic acid, which achieves the starvation therapy by depleting the energy and enhances the chemodynamic therapy effect by lowering the pH of the TME and producing extra H 2 O 2 . Meanwhile, the reactive oxygen species damage is amplified, as AMCc can constantly oxidize intracellular reductive glutathione through the cyclic valence alternation of Cu and Mn ions, and the generated Cu + elevate the production of ·OH from H 2 O 2 . Further studies depict that the well‐designed AMCc exhibits the excellent photothermal performance and achieves TME‐responsive sustainable starvation\/photothermal‐enhanced chemodynamic synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo. Overall, a promising approach is demonstrated here to design “all‐in‐one” nanozyme for theranostics by remodeling the TME.",

Iridium (Ir) and iridium oxides (IrO x ) are currently the most promising candidates for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium, which remains the bottleneck in water electrolysis. Yet, the extremely high costs for Ir hamper a widespread production of hydrogen (H 2 ) on an industrial scale. Herein, the authors report a concept for the synthesis of electrode coatings with template‐controlled mesoporosity surface‐modified with highly active Ir species. The improved utilization of noble metal species relies on the synthesis of soft‐templated metal oxide supports and a subsequent shape‐conformal deposition of Ir species via atomic layer deposition (ALD) at two different reaction temperatures. The study reveals that a minimum Ir content in the mesoporous titania‐based support is mandatory to provide a sufficient electrical bulk conductivity. After ALD, a significantly enhanced OER activity results in dependency of the ALD cycle number and temperature.

This is intrinsically related to the microstructure of membranes. For example, large and connected ionic clusters or pores in membranes are favorable for the ion transfer, but detrimental to the ion selectivity. While small and isolated hydrophilic ion clusters or pores suppress the water uptake and ion transfer, the decreased swelling ratio would enhance chemical stability of membrane. Thus, comprehensive strategies are required to realize the optimal balance between the ion selectivity, proton conductivity, and chemical stability.

Thus, these high‐energy electrons and holes are able to catalyze a variety of substrates in the tumor microenvironment, such as the reduction of oxygen and carbon dioxide to superoxide radicals and carbon monoxide (CO), and the oxidation of H 2 O to hydroxyl radicals, thus achieving sonodynamic therapy and CO combined therapy. Mechanistically, the generated reactive oxygen species and CO damage DNA and inhibit cancer cell energy levels, respectively, to synergistically induce tumor cell apoptosis. This study provides new insights into the realization of high efficiency and low toxicity in catalytic therapy from a unique perspective of materials design.

Advanced sheet materials supported by metal atom‐based materials have become a critical topic in the fields of renewable energy conversion systems, storage devices, sensors, and biomedicine owing to the maximum atom utilization efficiency, precisely located metal centers, specific electron configurations, unique reactivity, and precise chemical tunability.

    "abstract":"Abstract The chloroplast contains densely stacked arrays of light‐harvesting proteins that harness solar energy with theoretical maximum glucose conversion efficiencies approaching 12%. Few studies have explored isolated chloroplasts as a renewable, abundant, and low cost source for solar energy harvesting. One impediment is that photoactive proteins within the chloroplast become photodamaged due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In vivo, chloroplasts reduce photodegradation by applying a self‐repair cycle that dynamically replaces photodamaged components; outside the cell, ROS‐induced photodegradation contributes to limited chloroplast stability. The incorporation of chloroplasts into synthetic, light‐harvesting devices will require regenerative ROS scavenging mechanisms to prolong photoactivity. Herein, we study ROS generation within isolated chloroplasts extracted from S pinacia oleracea directly interfaced with nanoparticle antioxidants, including dextran‐wrapped nanoceria (dNC) previously demonstrated as a potent ROS scavenger. We quantitatively examine the effect of dNC, along with cerium ions, fullerenol, and DNA‐wrapped single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), on the ROS generation of isolated chloroplasts using the oxidative dyes, 2’,7’‐ dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H 2 DCF‐DA) and 2,3‐bis(2‐methoxy‐4‐nitro‐5‐sulfophenyl)‐2 H ‐tetrazolium‐5‐carboxanilide sodium salt (XTT). Electrochemical measurements confirm that chloroplasts processed from free solution can generate power under illumination.

These forbs were established in six different agronomic designs: three strip designs (one‐row, three‐rows, and six‐rows) and three community designs (monoculture, low‐richness polyculture, and high‐richness polyculture). Seed yield averaged 2995, 950, and 1157 kg ha −1 for Canada milk vetch, purple coneflower, and showy tick trefoil in the first year and declined for all species over time. Biomass yields averaged 6743, 2725, and 2869 kg ha −1 in the first year for Canada milk vetch, purple coneflower, and showy tick trefoil, respectively. Canada milk vetch biomass yields declined by 98% over time, and showy tick trefoil biomass yields increased by 40%. Seed and biomass yields were the lowest in one‐row strip design and greatest in the community designs, with little difference between monocultures and polycultures. Results suggest that production is maximized in community designs and that purple coneflower and showy tick trefoil have the potential for multiyear yields.",

Among many sustainability metrics to measure agriculture's impacts on sustainability and contribution to its improvements, we focus on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the agricultural sector as a key environmental indicator to assess several GHG mitigation practices from the perspective of life‐cycle analysis applied to agriculture. We first analyze the key factors contributing to farming GHG emissions and then identify a range of GHG mitigation strategies, such as optimizing farm fertilizer\/chemical inputs, manufacturing low‐carbon fertilizer\/chemical, reducing on‐farm energy\/fuel consumption, and increasing soil carbon stocks. Furthermore, we elaborate on how these strategies can be successfully implemented to different scales of farming through policies and incentives and better quantification and verification schemes for effective policies and incentives. Finally, we present the holistic evaluation of agricultural GHG emissions in terms of landscape management approaches and provide ecosystem services to address social and economic issues.",

Unlike traditional electrophilic or nucleophilic reactions, the free radical mechanism of photoredox catalysis opens up new routes to achieve unprecedented C−H bond functionalization. In this context, single‐electron transfer or energy transfer interactions among exogenous photocatalysts, i. e ., TM photocatalysts or organic dye photosensitizers, etc., in their excited state with the targeted substrate, thus generates active radical species, which encompasses the further elusive reaction pathways. This review covers the distinct radical generation methods via photoredox catalysis to trigger the C−H bond cleavage through visible light irradiation.

The Ni sites facilitate the adsorption and activation of NO 3 − , while the Co sites boost the H 2 O decomposition to supply active hydrogen (H ads ) for N‐containing intermediates hydrogenation on adjacent Ni sites, cooperatively reducing the energy barriers of NO 3 − RR process. Together with the accelerated electron transfer enabled by built‐in electric field, remarkable NO 3 − RR performance is achieved with an NH 3 yield rate of 11.46 mg h −1 cm −2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.4 %, outperforming most reported MOF‐based electrocatalysts.

    "abstract":"Abstract The pursuit of carbon‐neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni‐based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine‐rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH) 2 catalyst interfaced with laser‐ablated LiFePO 4 (Ni(OH) 2 \/L‐LFP), derived from spent Li‐ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO 4 3− species, formed around L‐LFP, effectively repels Cl − ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 enhances OH − adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm −2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3 % activity loss after 600 h at 100 mA cm −2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high‐performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.",

The dimerization between H I * and H II * for H 2 evolution is blocked due to the catalytic inertia of H I * thereby the H II * drives nitrate hydrogenation timely.

Continuous wave CO 2 laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe 2 O 4 @nitrogen‐doped carbon (CoFe 2 O 4 @NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe‐PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO 3 RR in 1.0 M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH 4 + production rate of 10.9 mg h −1 cm −2 at −0.47 V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode with exceptional stability.

Herein, a ternary salts‐based high‐entropy electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn 0.2 Na 0.4 Li 0.4 (ClO 4 ) 1.2 ⋅ 7H 2 O is proposed to address the above issues. The addition of perchlorate salts with different cations reduces the size of ion clusters, significantly increases the solvation structure species, and promotes the anion‐rich Zn 2+ solvation structures, resulting in an enlarged electrochemical stability window, favorable viscosity and ionic conductivity, and low freezing point. Furthermore, advanced characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that multiple types of solvation structures effectively increase the entropy of the electrolyte. As a consequence, the Zn\/Zn symmetric cells in HEE can sustainably cycle for at least 1000 hours and 1500 hours under room and subzero temperatures, respectively. The Na 0.33 V 2 O 5 \/Zn and polyaniline\/Zn full cells can even last for 30000 and 20000 cycles without capacity decay at −20 °C, respectively.

Platinum is one of the best catalysts for the reforming of hydrocarbons due to its high selectivity for CC bond cleavage.

The study provides the first data on distribution, life history, and genetic structure of the species at the upstream limit of its historic distribution (south‐western Germany). A 3‐year survey effort with 143 fishing events identified several small, fragmentary populations covering only 7% of the historical range of the species. Census population sizes ( N c ) of these subpopulations were estimated from mark–recapture data at &lt;200 individuals. Effective population sizes ( N e ), calculated from genetic data (microsatellite genotyping), were much smaller still, at &lt;15 individuals, resulting in an N c \/ N e ratio of &lt;0.25, strongly indicating that populations are seriously affected by genetic drift and inbreeding, and are thus facing a severe extinction risk. Life‐history parameters recorded during the study indicate a rapid life cycle, with both sexes probably attaining sexual maturity at the age of 1 year or older. Spawning commenced at the beginning of April and fecundity was low (~300–400 eggs per female). Genetic analysis and mark–recapture data indicate that subpopulations of the streber live in effective isolation, separated by impassable weirs that significantly reduce genetic connectivity between subpopulations. The species is rheophilic, and limited to sites with flow velocities of ~0.7 m s –1 . Hydropower infrastructure may thus also have diminished the availability of suitable habitat by reducing flow rates. Only 32% of the historical range of the Danube streber is now estimated to be morphologically suitable for the species. Furthermore, relevant parts of this range are located upstream of dams and are therefore not accessible for natural recolonization. The availability and accessibility of suitable habitats seem to be factors limiting the size of the remaining subpopulations. Conservation actions should address the restoration of degraded river habitats and increase the connectivity between isolated subpopulations of the Danube streber.",

This study assessed the impacts of two SHPs on freshwater fish communities in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India. Two dammed and one undammed tributary of the Netravathi River, having similar stream order, elevation, and surrounding land‐use types, were identified as test and control sites respectively. Stream geometry, water chemistry, and fish assemblages were compared across upstream, dewatered, and downstream location categories within and across the three streams. Flow alterations induced by SHPs affected the dewatered river stretches most severely. Stream wetted width and depths diminished drastically in dammed dewatered segments, and consequently this region was characterized by elevated water temperature and reduced dissolved oxygen. Fish species composition varied significantly between dammed and undammed sites, across the upstream, dewatered, and downstream location categories. Dammed segments had lower fish species richness, diversity, and endemicity, and were dominated by eurytopic species (adapted to lentic conditions), unlike the control site, which was dominated by rheophilic species (adapted to flowing waters). Regression analyses indicated that fish species richness in dammed streams increased with distance from the dam in the upstream direction. The SHPs were found to have severe impacts on stream geometry, water chemistry, and aquatic biota, especially in the dry season. Given the ambitious targets of planned SHP growth, most of which are within ecologically fragile regions, changes in SHP operations and policies are proposed to enable the conservation of river fish diversity.

Methods for measuring animal movements underwater are limited; however, active sonar can image marine mammals and could potentially measure three‐dimensional movements in tidally energetic locations. Here, a dual 720 kHz sonar system was developed to investigate the three‐dimensional movements of harbour seals ( Phoca vitulina ) in a tidally energetic channel. Estimated mean depth (distance from the surface) of seals was 12.0 m (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 11.6–12.4 m), and the majority of time was spent at the surface and at approximately 10–12 m distance from the surface. When expressed as distances from the sea bed, mean distance was 18.5 m (95% CI: 18.0–18.9 m), and the majority of time was spent at 14 m from the sea bed. Seal movements were generally in the same direction as the tidal flow with mean horizontal speeds of between 0.51 and 3.13 m s −1 (95% CIs = 1.24–1.54 m s −1 ). Mean vertical velocities (where negative and positive values represent a descent and ascent respectively) for each seal track ranged between −1.76 and +0.88 m s −1 (95% CIs: −0.23 to +0.03 m s −1 ). These results provide a basis for understanding how seals utilize a dynamic tidal environment and suggest that harbour seal behaviour can be markedly different to less tidally energetic habitats. The results also have important implications for the prediction of risk associated with interactions between diving seals and tidal turbines in these dynamic habitats.",

    "title":"Measuring responses of harbour seals to potential aversive acoustic mitigation signals using controlled exposure behavioural response studies",
    "abstract":"Abstract Some anthropogenic activities pose acute risks for marine species. For example, pile driving could damage the hearing of marine mammals while underwater explosions can also result in physical damage or death. Effective mitigation is required to reduce these risks, but the exclusion zones specified in regulations can extend over hundreds or thousands of metres and seals pose particular problems because they are difficult to detect at sea. Aversive sound mitigation aims to exclude animals from high‐risk areas before dangerous activities take place by broadcasting specific acoustic signals. Field research is needed to identify signals that might be effective in eliciting short‐term avoidance by marine species such as harbour seals ( Phoca vitulina ). A series of controlled‐exposure experiments (CEEs) were undertaken to measure seal movements in response to acoustic deterrent devices (ADD) and predator calls, and to assess the effectiveness of candidate signals for aversive sound mitigation. Seals were fitted with UHF\/GPS transmitters providing continuous high‐resolution tracks and real‐time transmissions of their locations. A tracking\/playback vessel located seals at sea and transmitted either ADD signals or orca ( Orcinus orca ) calls over a range of distances while seals were foraging or moving between sites. Behaviour before, during and after exposure was analysed to assess responses. One‐hundred and ten CEEs were assessed as being of at least ‘adequate’ quality. Of the 71 adequate trials with the Lofitech ADD, all 38 at ranges of &lt;1 km (predicted received level 134.6 dB RMS re 1 μPa) elicited a response. The maximum response range was 3123 m (predicted RL: 111 dB RMS re 1 μPa). However, the responses observed did not always result in substantial movements away from the source, especially for seals that were travelling at the time of the exposures. More work is needed to better understand how exposure risks would be reduced in different scenarios. The mean net speed of horizontal movements for seals responding to aversive sounds (1.15 m s −1 ) was only 7% higher than their mean travel speed. Responses to broadcasts of orca calls were highly variable. The results suggest that signals similar to those generated by a Lofitech ADD could be used to reduce risks to harbour seals from pile driving and underwater explosions in coastal waters. More work will be needed to develop systems that match the requirements of industry and regulators and to explore whether these results can be generalized to offshore waters and to other phocids.",

    "title":"Variability in coral reef fish baseline and benchmark biomass in the central and western Indian Ocean provinces",
    "abstract":"Abstract Reef fish biomass is increasingly recognized as a key indicator of fishery and biodiversity status linked to ecosystem integrity on coral reefs, and yet the evaluation of appropriate baselines for biomass, and what drives variation in potential baselines, is sparse. Variability in reef fishable biomass was assessed to test for the existence of baselines or benchmarks (B&amp;Bs), based on field studies of 223 reef sites in remote uninhabited reefs, in high‐compliance closures of &gt;5 km 2 , and among the increasing number of small and recent closures. The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of human habitation, travel time and distance to cities, habitat, depth, benthic cover, and environmental variables on fish B&amp;Bs. There were large differences in the three categories of ‘no fishing’, with human habitation being the single best predictor of biomass. In remote areas without people (&gt;9 hours of travel time), fish biomass had a mean of 2,450 kg ha –1 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 2,130–2,770 kg ha –1 ; median = 1,885 kg ha –1 ). In these remote areas, biomass was weakly associated with human travel time to the site and, to a lesser extent, wave energy. In high‐compliance closures, fish biomass peaked at 20 years and 5–10 km 2 , and levelled at 910 kg ha –1 (95% CI 823–989 kg ha –1 ) for both closure age and size. There was little evidence that human travel time and environmental factors influenced biomass greatly in these established closures. In small and recent closures (&lt;15 years), habitat, depth and closure age were the best predictors of fish biomass. Based on the weakness of environmental factors, country or site‐specific B&amp;Bs are not required in these two provinces. However, human habitation in the seascape as well as the size and age of closures set limits to the maximum achievable biomass. The importance of environmental factors increases as the no‐fishing areas and closure times decline. Reef wilderness is not widespread in these provinces, but provides key services and therefore needs to be included in conservation and fisheries policy and management goals.",

    "title":"Harbour porpoise (<scp><i>Phocoena phocoena<\/i><\/scp>) presence is reduced during tidal turbine operation",
    "abstract":"Abstract Uptake of tidal turbine technology to generate renewable energy has been partly limited by poor understanding of ecological impacts, including the potential for collisions between cetaceans and rotating turbine blades. To address this concern, it is necessary to identify whether cetaceans behaviourally respond to operating turbines. A turbine in Scotland was instrumented with hydrophones to detect cetacean vocalizations. A generalized additive model was used to investigate temporal variability in harbour porpoise presence close to the turbine. As there were incidentally periods when the turbine was not operating, it was possible to determine the effect of blade rotation, whilst accounting for the potentially confounding effect of tidal flow. Harbour porpoise presence varied intra‐annually, diurnally and with tidal state. Peak presence occurred during winter (September–February), at night and at high flow speeds on the flood tide. Porpoises exhibited significant avoidance of the tidal turbine when it was operating; avoidance increased with flow speed, whereby mean porpoise presence was reduced by up to 78% (95% CIs, 51%, 91%) on the flood tide and up to 64% (95% CI, 3%, 91%) on the ebb tide. The temporal variability in encounter rate in the present study highlights that collision risk assessments assuming static densities probably fail to capture the temporal variability of collision risk. Future studies should conduct long‐term baseline monitoring to derive encounter rates at larger spatio‐temporal scales and as a reference from which to measure change in habitat use. It is also critical that the generality of the avoidance rates presented here is assessed for other sites, turbine types, array sizes and cetacean species. As the tidal industry expands, it will be important to reconcile the benefits of avoidance responses from a collision risk perspective with potential chronic effects of displacement from, or barriers between, important habitats.",
